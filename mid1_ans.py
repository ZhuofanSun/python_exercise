'''
When this program starts, a new window opens.
The window is 500 x 400 pixels, has a black background
and a title "Colourful Dots".
The game features two dots which bounce around the screen
and a thin vertical white line which divides the screen in half.

There is a score in the top left corner of the window. It says "Score :"
in size 64 white text, followed by the number of seconds which
have passed since the start of the program.

Both dots start at a fixed location, move with constant speed in a straight
line (speed described below for each ball), and bounce off the window edges.

One dot is green when it is completely on the
left half of the screen and blue when it is completely
on the right hand side of the screen.

The other dot is always white when completely on
the left half of the screen and red when completely
on the right half of the screen.

If either dot is in the center of the zone --- i.e. any part of the dot is
touching the dividing line--- the dot turns yellow.

The green/blue dot has a radius of 30 and starts at position [50,75].
It moves twice as fast vertically as it does horizontally.

The white/red dot has a radius of 40 and starts at position [200,100].
It moves twice as fast horizontally as it does vertically.

If both dots are touching the center line at the same time
(i.e. if both dots are yellow), the game ends.
Both dots no longer move.

If the player clicks the close window button, the window closes.
